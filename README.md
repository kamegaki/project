For Desktop/laptop you need to download the folder "Gameproject" and then run WizardAdventures.exe

For Mobile you just need to install and run the apk
## Executing program
1- Download

2- run

3- play

For mobile there might be a problem with the buttuns because of the screen size of the differnt phone. I have 7.2 inch display and the buttons are in the correct position. To accees the pause menu you have to press back key on the home buttons and if you use pause menu to go to diffrent level you might be stuck but to undo that you have to open and close pause menu.

For Desktop/laptop you use arrow keys to move left and right and to jump and use the Z key to attack and use escape key to use pause menu
